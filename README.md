This project provides a comprehensive analysis of Netflix’s movie and TV show catalog (2008–2021), based on a publicly available dataset. The study explores trends in content strategy through attributes such as content type, director, cast, country, release year, genre, duration, and rating.

Workflow followed:

Data loading & inspection to understand structure and statistics.

Cleaning & preprocessing: handled missing values, removed duplicates, standardized formats.

Feature engineering: converted duration into minutes, ensured consistent genre categories, extracted insights from release year and country.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): visualized content trends using Matplotlib, Seaborn, WordCloud, and Plotly.

Key insights:

Movies dominate the catalog, but TV shows show consistent growth.

The United States, India, and the United Kingdom are top content producers.

Dramas, comedies, and documentaries are the most common genres.

Ratings like TV-MA and TV-14 prevail, highlighting a focus on mature audiences.

Future scope:

Development of a content-based recommendation system (TF-IDF + cosine similarity).

Application of clustering techniques for genre-based grouping.

Creation of interactive dashboards for dynamic filtering and deeper exploration.

Overall, this project demonstrates the end-to-end data analytics pipeline—from raw data to actionable insights—offering a strong framework to understand Netflix’s evolving content strategy and the broader streaming landscape.
